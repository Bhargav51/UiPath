title: "UiNode.Extract - extract structured data from web pages"
---
##Overview
We are going to learn how to use the quite amazing "Extract Data" workflow activity in [UiPath]([http://www.uipath.com/).
We'll expose various tricks with using the wizards and we'll get a little bit into the internals of [UiNode.ExtractData](https://github.com/Deskover/UiPath/wiki/Uinode#wiki-ExtractData) library method.


##Problem
A lot of data is available online these days but you don't usually have access to a web API to extract it.
Finance and stock info, real estate data, product catalogs, search engine results, social networks feeds, all come in various formats.
Here is where UiPath comes to rescue. With its powerful (and yet easy to use) new workflow-based technology, it can automatically recognize the repeating patterns inside structured and tabular data.

With no programming skills required, you can easily save web data in your favorite format: Excel, CSV, text or even directly deliver it to a database or web-service.

##How to
Usually the data you want to extract is not on the first page of the web site. You'll have to perform some login, search, navigation steps first.
Fortunately, all these steps are automatically generated by UiPath web recorder. Just press "Record" toolbar button and perform all necessary steps to get to the page containing the data.
We won't focus on recording feature right now as it will be covered in another blog post.

Let's say we want to extract some books info from: http://shop.oreilly.com/category/browse-subjects/programming/python.do
Choose **Extract Web Data/Extract Single Page Web Data** from toolbar in UiPath workflow designer.
There is also **Extract Multi-Page Web Data** which is able to iterate thru multiple pages.
You only have to specify the "Next" anchor / button to advance to the next page.

First you are asked to select the first field which in our case is the book title.
Actually you have to indicate TWO titles so we can programatically detect some data patterns.
Let's say we select the first and second book. The result is probably not what you wanted (you want the whole thing and not only the first row).

If you select the first and second book title of the first column you'll ended up with the first column as the result.
Sometimes you have to play a little bit with the selection until you get it right. In our scenario you need to select two books that are not on the same column and row so the result is the whole table (diagonally).
Sometimes it seems like the software has a mind of its own and the results may be surprising.

When defining the next fields you have to use the same entities you used in step one. In our case, if you want to extract the author name you should use the same two books you used at step one to define the books title.
It's usually better to select objects at the beginning and the end of the table.

If the structured data is actually a &lt;table&gt; object then the wizard will ask you to extract the whole table or not. In our case this approach won't work very well because we need title, author and prices as separated data (they are all in the same &lt;td&gt;).
Anyway when asked, you should always give "extract whole table" option a try.

In rare scenarios not all data is extracted like inn google or amazon search results.
Promotional products, special offers or paid search results may look the same as the rest of the data but they have different internal HTML structure.
You can define two extract data scenarios one for the regular data and another for special items.

##Internals


##Conclusions
 * you have to select a field twice so the software can better analyze the internal HTML structure and define data patterns.
 * play with selection to get a row, a column or the whole thing
 * always use the same entities at each step to define all the fields
 * select at the top and bottom of the table
 * try "extract whole table" option if available
 * define additional "extract data" activities for special items that differs internally from the rest of the regular data
 * as a last resort you can try to edit the XML selectors data to alter the result

Until next time.
