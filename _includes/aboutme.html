Deskover is a privately held software company, founded in 2004. Since then, we've been working hard on several great products, both for consumers and businesses. Our story goes like any other story: we had the courage to begin, we had the patience to overcome the hard times, and the passion to go on. Beyond all these, our long, very long work hours have been paid off by our customers who use our products every day.</p>
